    <h1>About Dudely Dylan</h1>
    <p>My name is Dylan, I'm 23 and I am a pretty goofy dude.</p>
    <p>
      I love to play Golf and video games. I also enjoy woodworking and one day
      I will have an entire epic workshop.
    </p>
    <p>Some cool stuff I did:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm a self taught adult, I had to grow up on my own.</li>
      <li>I once ate so much sour stuff my tongue bled, it was crazy yo.</li>
      <li>I recently got engaged to the most awesome person in the world.</li>
    </ul>
